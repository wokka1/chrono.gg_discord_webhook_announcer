# chrono.gg announcement webhook 1.0
This simple python script intends to announce the chrono.gg url into your discord channel (yes, you could use the same setup for any URL)

As an admin of a discord channel, click the gear on the channel and add a webhook, grab the URL from there and replace the one below in the variables, execute the script to push the url to the discord channel.  There is no scheduler, I use a crontab entry on linux for that

# changelog :
Initial 1.0

no warranty or support comes with this, use it as you want

change the variables accordingly in the script
